# Professional Portfolio

## Description

This is my first attempt at making a professional webpage to present my portfolio. It's simple, but it does what it needs to do. In it, I have a brief description of myself and my background, a featured project of mine, a list of other projects that I have done, and my contact information. 

~~ Cool Features! ~~
* Links have RBY-color backgrounds that appear upon hover.
* Elements will enlarge upon hover.
* Smooth scrolling from navigation link jumps.
